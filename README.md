# Pathfinder Neural Network 

Recently I designed and created a neural network I dubbed 'Pathfinder' using PHP and the FANN Library. Pathfinder is an example of a neural network that is capable of plotting an 8 direction step path from a starting position in a 5x5 grid to an ending position in that grid. 

To keep the Pathfinder example simple it is not trained to deal with walls or non-traversable terrain however it would be very easy to add that by adding additional training. 

Recently Pathfinder was accepted as an example of how to use FANN on the [Official PHP FANN Github](https://github.com/bukka/php-fann).

## Videos
* [Demonstration](Videos/Demonstration.m4v) This video demonstrates how Pathfinder navigates around the grid. 

* [Encode & Decode](Videos/Encode_Decode_Grid.mp4) This video illustrates how to encode and decode grid values when working with Pathfinder. 


## Basic
This is the simplest example of Pathfinder and is the version that is included with the Official FANN repo.
