# Pathfinder Neural Network 

I designed and created a neural network I dubbed 'Pathfinder' using PHP and the FANN Library. Pathfinder is an example of a neural network that is capable of plotting an 8 direction step path (cardinal points + diagonals) from a starting position in a 5x5 grid to an ending position in that grid. 

To keep the Pathfinder example simple it is not trained to deal with walls or non-traversable terrain however it would be very easy to add that by adding additional training. 

Pathfinder was accepted as an example of how to use FANN on the [Official PHP FANN Github](https://github.com/bukka/php-fann).


## Online / JS Version
This version of Pathfinder is implemented using [FANN.js](https://github.com/louisstow/fann.js/) and a live version is available on GitHub Pages.

**Live Preview:** [https://geekgirljoy.github.io/Pathfinder_Neural_Network/](https://geekgirljoy.github.io/Pathfinder_Neural_Network/)


## Basic / PHP Version
This is the simplest example of Pathfinder and is the version that is included with the Official [PHP FANN](https://github.com/bukka/php-fann) repo.

* [pathfinder_train.php](Basic/pathfinder_train.php)

* [pathfinder_test.php](Basic/pathfinder_test.php)

* [pathfinder.data](Basic/pathfinder.data)

*Note* PHP FANN is required for the code contained in this repo to run.
